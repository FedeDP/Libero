# Libero
In italy we got this beautiful and funny newspaper called "Libero Quotidiano".  
Well, it is so funny that i had to make a small, stupid c program to download their page and check some words occurrences :D  

To build, it only needs libcurl and pkg-config (only needed at build time).  
To run:
    
    $ ./libero list of words to be searched

It will then print each words occurrences.
